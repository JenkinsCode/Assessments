# Week 2 Assessment

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?
The .filter() will return a smaller array.

2. Why would you use object destructuring?
It makes the code cleaner and easier to read.

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
"Var" tends to be used on a global scope and can be changed if need be. "let" tends to be used within the scope of a function. Const tends to be used when you dont want the variable to change throughout the process of adding additional code.  

4. Why is testing important?
Testing is important because it can help catch smaller bugs sooner. I think small bugs can turn into bigger bugs if not addressed from the get go. I also think it goes in hand with talking about what you want your application to do and once you figure that out, you can assess what needs to be tested.

5. What is a higher order function?
Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?
 A class is a vague definition on how things will be within my code. They are also seen as a blueprint. So, if I created a user class that takes in first name, last name and age. The object would be the filler information my class is looking to fill.


7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.
  I learned that I have to be more confident and speak up during group projects. Otherwise, I will slip into the void of silence and confusion.

### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

 You create a separate file and save it as a css file. Then you link it to your html within the <head> portion of your file using a <link> tag.

2. What is the difference between a div and a span?
   Span is an inline approach and span would be used to span a larger block of code. Divs would be more useful when combined with flex box.

    An ID would be used to style one thing on your page vs a class can be used to style multiple elements on a page.
