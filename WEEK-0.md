#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is a block of code that has a job. It can be called to perform that job or task as many times as I need it to. It can also take multiple arguments.

#### 2. What is a method?
A method is preset syntax that can help you play with your data.

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
var sentence = "Robert is checking in"

console.log(sentence.indexOf("c")) console.log(sentence.length) console.log(sentence.replace("c", "s")) console.log(sentence.toUpperCase()) console.log(sentence.toLowerCase())
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
Accessor (getter) methods only let you look at data--they don't change it. Mutator (setter) methods let you change data. I would use the accessor to look up specific properties of an object. I would use Mutator methods to change information within the property.
#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
console.log() only prints what you ask it to print on to the console. Return on the other hand, is like console.log() in that it will print. However, Return is used when running functions or arrays. Also, returns can only be used once within a function.
#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
I suppose it was when we broke off into pairs and were able to mess with the challenges.
